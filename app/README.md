# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})


```

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USEPA/power-sector-dev-portal.git
```

2. Navigate to the app folder in the project directory:
```bash
cd power-sector-dev-portal/app
```

3.Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

# Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server from the app folder to preview the app locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will usually start the development server at http://localhost:5173/power-sector-dev-portal/

To build the project for deployment, use the following command:
``` bash
npm run deploy
```

This will bundle the project for production then deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

```

# Deployment
The app is deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. To deploy the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
This will build the project and push it to the gh-pages branch.

**Note**: Ensure the .nojekyll file is present in the gh-pages branch to properly render the markdown content.

# Functions & Utilities
This project contains several functions and utilities for rendering the markdown content.

## Custom Hooks:
- **useMarkdownContent**: A custom hook that fetches and renders markdown content from the public/content folder.

## Utility Functions:
- **extractBanner**: Extracts the banner information (e.g., image, title) from the markdown content.
- **extractInfo**: Extracts general information from the markdown files (e.g., metadata).
- **extractSections**: Extracts and formats the sections of the markdown content into a structured format.

# Updating page content
To update a specific page:
Locate the appropriate markdown file in the public/content folder. All content is optional. Content types can be found in the types/ContentTypes.tsx file. Some pages have a slightly different structure, but the general layout is as follows:

Edit the fields you wish to change
Add or remove sections as needed by adding or removing section blocks
Save the file - changes will be reflected when the site is rebuilt

- **title**: Found on top level pages, used in banners like the Power Sector Dev Portal homepage
- **tagline**: Optional paragraph text included in some banners, like the design elements page
- **introTitle**: Intro header found on most pages, like the color page. Typically called "Introduction"
- **introContent**: Intro paragraphs found on most pages, like the color page. Can be more than one paragraph
- **introImage**: Intro image, not found on many pages except the Using the Theme and Best Practices Pages

- **sections**: Wrapper for page content. A new section is created using the - symbol. A section cannot have more than one of each parameter (image, title, level), but all parameters are optional.
    - **title**: String used for header content
    - **level**: Number used to designate header level (e.g., 2 for h2, 3 for h3)
    - **content**: String for paragraph content. Can be multiple paragraphs
    - **image**: Relative path for images, found in public assets folder
    - **alt**: Alt text for images. If missing, image will use the title as alt text


- **code**: Array of code snippets (see CodeSnippet interface)
    - **language**: Code language. Will always be 'r'
    - **content**: Code body text

- **cards**: Array of card content (see Card interface below)
    - **content**: Card body text
    - **image**: Path to card image
    - **alt**: Alt text for card image
    - **imagemb**: Mobile-specific image path (if different from desktop)
    - **type**: Either "default", "do", or "do not" - used to style "Things to avoid" and "Best Practices" cards

- **downloads**: Array of downloadable content (see Download interface)
    - **link**: URL for any linked content, should link to a **zip** folder if more than one file is to be downloaded
    - **title**: Download header text

## Markdown Formatting
The content uses the ReactMarkdown library, which means you can include Markdown formatting within content strings:

Use *text* or _text_ for italic text
Use **text** or __text__ for bold text
Use # Header for main headers (though these are typically handled by the title parameter)
Use backticks for inline code
Use triple backticks for code blocks
Create links with [link text](URL)
Create bulleted lists with - item or * item
Create numbered lists with 1. item

## Multiple Elements
If you need multiple elements of the same type (e.g., two images next to each other), create separate sections with one element each. For example:

```bash
sections:
  - image: "/path/to/first-image.png"
    alt: "First image description"
  - image: "/path/to/second-image.png"
    alt: "Second image description"
```

## Content Handling Notes

- If a field is missing, it will simply not be rendered - no error will occur
- Use the pipe symbol | for multi-paragraph content in YAML
- Indentation is important in the YAML structure - maintain consistent indentation
- For complex content that needs HTML features, you can include HTML directly within markdown content as ReactMarkdown supports this. Verify that the page you are editing contains the `<ReactMarkdown>` tag as not all pages currently use this

## Example Updates

Testing Content Changes
After making changes to content files:

Run the development server to preview changes locally using `npm run dev` from the app folder
