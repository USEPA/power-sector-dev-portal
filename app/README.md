# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})


```

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USEPA/power-sector-dev-portal.git
```

2. Navigate to the app folder in the project directory:
```bash
cd power-sector-dev-portal/app
```

3.Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

# Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server from the app folder to preview the app locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will usually start the development server at http://localhost:5173/power-sector-dev-portal/

To build the project for deployment, use the following command:
``` bash
npm run deploy
```

This will bundle the project for production then deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

```

# Deployment
The app is deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. To deploy the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
This will build the project and push it to the gh-pages branch.

**Note**: Ensure the .nojekyll file is present in the gh-pages branch to properly render the markdown content.

# Functions & Utilities
This project contains several functions and utilities for rendering the markdown content.

## Custom Hooks:
- **useMarkdownContent**: A custom hook that fetches and renders markdown content from the public/content folder.

## Utility Functions:
- **extractBanner**: Extracts the banner information (e.g., image, title) from the markdown content.
- **extractInfo**: Extracts general information from the markdown files (e.g., metadata).
- **extractSections**: Extracts and formats the sections of the markdown content into a structured format.

# Updating page content
To update a specific page:
Locate the appropriate markdown file in the public/content folder. All content is optional. Content types can be found in the types/ContentTypes.tsx file. Some pages have a slightly different structure, but the general layout is as follows:

Edit the fields you wish to change
Add or remove sections as needed by adding or removing section blocks
Save the file - changes will be reflected when the site is rebuilt

- **title**: Found on top level pages, used in banners like the Power Sector Dev Portal homepage
- **tagline**: Optional paragraph text included in some banners, like the design elements page
- **introTitle**: Intro header found on most pages, like the color page. Typically called "Introduction"
- **introContent**: Intro paragraphs found on most pages, like the color page. Can be more than one paragraph
- **introImage**: Intro image, not found on many pages except the Using the Theme and Best Practices Pages

- **sections**: Wrapper for page content. A new section is created using the - symbol. A section cannot have more than one of each parameter (image, title, level), but all parameters are optional.
    - **title**: String used for header content
    - **level**: Number used to designate header level (e.g., 2 for h2, 3 for h3)
    - **content**: String for paragraph content. Can be multiple paragraphs
    - **image**: Relative path for images, found in public assets folder
    - **alt**: Alt text for images. If missing, image will use the title as alt text


- **code**: Array of code snippets (see CodeSnippet interface)
    - **language**: Code language. Will always be 'r'
    - **content**: Code body text

- **cards**: Array of card content (see Card interface below)
    - **content**: Card body text
    - **image**: Path to card image
    - **alt**: Alt text for card image
    - **imagemb**: Mobile-specific image path (if different from desktop)
    - **type**: Either "default", "do", or "do not" - used to style "Things to avoid" and "Best Practices" cards

- **downloads**: Array of downloadable content (see Download interface)
    - **link**: URL for any linked content, should link to a **zip** folder if more than one file is to be downloaded
    - **title**: Download header text

## Markdown Formatting
The content uses the ReactMarkdown library, which means you can include Markdown formatting within content strings:

Use *text* or _text_ for italic text
Use **text** or __text__ for bold text
Use # Header for main headers (though these are typically handled by the title parameter)
Use backticks for inline code
Use triple backticks for code blocks
Create links with [link text](URL)
Create bulleted lists with - item or * item
Create numbered lists with 1. item

## Multiple Elements
If you need multiple elements of the same type (e.g., two images next to each other), create separate sections with one element each. For example:

```bash
sections:
  - image: "/path/to/first-image.png"
    alt: "First image description"
  - image: "/path/to/second-image.png"
    alt: "Second image description"
```

## Content Handling Notes

If a field is missing, it will simply not be rendered - no error will occur
Use the pipe symbol | for multi-paragraph content in YAML
Indentation is important in the YAML structure - maintain consistent indentation
For complex content that needs HTML features, you can include HTML directly within markdown content as ReactMarkdown supports this. Verify that the page you are editing contains the `<ReactMarkdown>` tag as not all pages currently use this

## Example Updates

Testing Content Changes
After making changes to content files:

Run the development server to preview changes locally
Check both desktop and mobile views to ensure content displays correctly
Verify that any markdown formatting renders as expected
Confirm that all images load properly and have appropriate alt text
