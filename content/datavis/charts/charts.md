introTitle: "Charts"
introContent: "There are two common approaches to choosing the right chart. One is to focus on the kind of underlying data you have: are you working with quantitative or categorical values? Are you representing absolute values or changes within a value? The other is to focus on the story you’re trying to tell with the data, or the insights you want people to walk away with: Are you trying to emphasize a change? Are you trying to compare two groups to each other or to a third value? In this guide, we focus on the second method, by starting with the “purpose” of a chart."

      - title: "Area Charts"
        content: "Area charts can impart an overall sense of changing proportions; use them if the exact values of each category are less important than the composition of the whole and how the combination changes over time."

      - title: "Bar and Column Charts"
        content: "Bar and column charts are useful when you have data you want to compare across categories on a nominal or ordinal scale or have time-based, discrete data."

      - title: "Stacked Bar and Column Charts"
        content: "Stacked bar and column charts are most helpful when comparing multiple subcategories to their respective category totals. They’re less helpful if you need to make comparisons between individual subcategories."

      - title: "Tree Maps"
        content: "Tree maps are good for communicating hierarchy as well as proportions, though it is sometimes difficult to make exact comparisons between sizes of rectangles if they vary in both width and height. Tree maps may take some getting used to for users."

        content: "Parallel plots show how categories compare across a variety of metrics, sometimes of different ranges and units. They are also helpful in revealing potential correlations between those metrics within or across categories."

      - title: "Data Tables"
        content: "If you have a lot of data and you want users to be able to search for and find specific values in it, data tables offer a more efficient approach than visualizations. If you format your table well, it can also facilitate comparisons between individual values."

        content: "Using a visually noticeable, text-based representation for the number you want audiences to focus on sometimes works better than producing an entire visual."

    cards:
      - title: "Bubble Charts"
        content: "Bubble charts show correlations like scatterplots do, with the added benefit of encoding an additional metric in the size of the points (turning them into bubbles). Always scale the size of a bubble’s area, not radius, relative to the encoded value."

        content: "Scatterplots are useful to show potential correlations—and their directions and magnitudes—across individual data points. Adding lines of best fit can help make those things clearer."

        content: "Bullet charts are helpful for quickly identifying which in a series of variables is meeting a particular mark. They are also often used to denote “good” or “bad” performances, and so may not be as helpful in value-neutral visualizations."
