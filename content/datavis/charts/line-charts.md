        Line charts are most useful when you want to show trends over time in continuous, quantitative data. If you have more than five or six categories, you might want to consider a different chart type or highlight only a few lines, as charts with too many lines can become confusing to read.

      - If you’re creating a chart with more than one line, directly label lines or use styles like dashes to distinguish between multiple lines to avoid forcing users to rely on color alone.
      - If you’re creating a single-line chart, use a neutral color (#2E2E2E) for the line (unless you’re plotting a variable that falls into one of the groups outlined in the categorical palettes section).
      - Because they focus more on trends than absolute values, the y-axes of line charts don’t need to start at zero (like those of bar charts do).
      - If your multiple-line chart exists to highlight a few lines against many others, use a light gray (#C9C9C9) for the lines in which you’re not immediately interested.
      - If your multiple-line chart exists to make comparisons between a few (no more than 5) lines, use color for each line.

    level: 2
    content: |
        Sparklines are only intended to show general trends and at-a-glance patterns, so you should not use them if users need to be able to pick out specific values. They work well in tables or in visualizations that are information-dense.

        - Always show the “chart space” of a sparkline (either by putting a fill on the background or using divider lines).
        - The appropriate way to apply scaling to your sparklines varies depending on what you’re trying to focus on: if you’re interested only in the pattern of change over time, scale the y-axis of each sparkline independently. If you’re interested in being able to make comparisons in values across sparklines, scale them all the same, either a predetermined range, or from the highest to the lowest value in the sparklines’ dataset.

      image: "/assets/datavis/charts/line-charts/standard-static-axes.png"
      content: Setting a standard, static axis (where every sparkline has the same axis regardless of the data they all contain) is best if you’re interested in being able to make comparisons in values across sparklines on repeated viewings where being able to put them in context is important (e.g., data updates regularly). It also works well for datasets with set maximums and minimums, such as percents of wholes.

      image: "/assets/datavis/charts/line-charts/non-standard-static-axes.png"
      content: Setting the axis to accommodate the highest and lowest points of the dataset is best if you’re interested in being able to make comparisons in values across sparklines but don’t care about possible changes to the axis if the data changes.
