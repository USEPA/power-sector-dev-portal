        Maps are most useful when you have data that needs to be communicated geographically: when patterns or trends in the data exist along geographies.

        You might want to consider a different chart type if:
        - Your audience doesn’t need to “see” the geography underlying the data. Ask yourself whether a table of states (for example) be enough to communicate the information.
        - The physical geography would cause bias in interpreting the data. (For example, larger states are more visually salient--does this influence how reader interpret your map by putting undue emphasis on those states?) Ask yourself if the geography is overwhelming other aspects of your data.

      Before deciding what kind of map to create, you should think about whether you’re plotting point or shape data. For example, power plants are point data, while counties, regions, and states are shape data. When dealing with shapes, also think about granularity: are you hiding valuable geographic trends in, say, emissions by aggregating data up to the state level that would be better shown at the county level? Or the reverse: are you hiding valuable data about states’ emissions by plotting individual plants when you could be showing that data at the state level?
  - title: "Choropleth Maps"
    level: 2
    content: |
      Use a choropleth map when your data can be normalized and aggregated up to a common geographic boundary, such as counties or states. The focus with this type of map is on how a variable affects place.

      - Your map’s text should have high contrast with your basemap, but with an outline that’s a similar shade; this helps makes it readable against any map elements.
          - Text should sit on top of any additional layers so it stays legible.
      - In general, if your data is not already expressed in terms of percentages or rates, you should normalize it. This helps to avoid allowing the size or population of your geography to skew perceptions of the data. For ­example, if you’re producing a map that shows impacts of emissions on different populations, using data per capita will make comparisons between block groups, counties, or states easier than using raw counts.

    cards:
    - title: "Text"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-text-do-not.png"
      content: Text should not sit underneath other layers, lack a border, or have a low-contrast color.
      type: "do not"
    - title: "Data"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-data-do-not.png"
      content: Don’t plot raw counts on a map (unless the focus is purely on population, for example).

  - title: "Color Palettes"
    level: 3 
    content: |
      Use different color palettes depending on how many variables and what kinds of changes to them you want to show in your choropleth map.
    cards:
    - title: "Sequential Palette"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-palettes-sequential.png"
      content: Use this color palette when showing difference in one direction for a single variable.
      type: "default"
    - title: "Divergent Palette"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-palettes-divergent.png"
      content: Use this color palette when showing differences in a single variable whose data has a clear midpoint.
      type: "default"
    - title: "Bivariate Palette"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-palettes-bivariate.png"
      content: Use this color palette to show differences in two variables simultaneously.

      Use different color palettes depending on how many variables and what kinds of changes to them you want to show in your choropleth map.
    cards:
    - title: "Linear Interpolation"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-interpolation-linear.png"
      content: This interpolation is best if your data is evenly distributed or, if not, when you want to highlight outliers. However, it makes it harder to discern between data points because many will have a similar color.
      type: "default"
    - title: "Quantiles"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-interpolation-quantiles.png"
      content: This interpolation minimizes the effect of outliers on the color scale, but also makes it hard to differentiate between “high” and “super high” for instance. (It makes outliers harder to spot.)
      type: "default"
    - title: "Natural Breaks/Jenks"
      image: "/assets/images/datavis/charts/maps/choropleth-interpolation-natural.png"
      content: This interpolation is a compromise between linear and quantiles. It’s a way of splitting your data into groups that maximizes the differences between the groups while minimizing differences inside of them. It results in groups with fewer far apart data points and more close together data points so that differences between data groups are easier to spot while still showing outliers.
      type: "default"
  - title: "Point Maps"
    level: 2
    content: |
      If your data cannot or should not be normalized or aggregated to broader geographic areas, you can use a point or bubble map to show it. Point maps are best for showing precisely where and what things are, especially when combined with icons. For example, a map showing what kinds of power plants are near cities, rivers, or other geographic features could be a point map with different icons representing different types of power plants.

      - If using icons, keep them simple, high-contrast, and fixed-size in relation to the data they represent (they can scale slightly while zooming in and out for legibility)
        - Do not scale icons relative to the data. (It’s hard for people to gauge differences in size of irregular objects.)

  - title: "Bubble Maps"
    level: 2
    content: |
      If your data cannot or should not be normalized or aggregated to broader geographic areas, you can use a point or bubble map to show it. Bubble maps are best for showing amounts in addition to specific, point-based locations. They’re also good for visualizing information about absolute numbers. For example, to visualize emissions from the power plants you identified in a point map, you could use bubbles to represent tons of emissions.
  - title: "Best Practices"
    level: 3
    content: |
      - Bubbles should be a little bit see-through (their opacity should be less than 100%).
      - Data should map to bubble area, not radius. This should always be made clear in a legend.
      - If possible, adjust the scale for bubble sizes when data is filtered so the full extent of the scale is being used.
      - Don’t use more than one characteristic (e.g., both color and size) to encode the same variable. For example, if emissions are being shown by the size of the bubbles, you don’t also need to add a color scale to show the same thing.
