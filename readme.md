# EPA Power Sector Dev Portal

## Brief Project Description

This repository contains a project that provides guidance on creating data products within EPA's Power Sector.
It includes the Clean Air and Power Division (CAPD) Data Visualization Style Guide (DVSG), which provides best practices for use when producing new data visualizations or updating existing ones. It includes high-level principles, chart-specific guidance, and advice on common chart-related design elements.

A related project, the [Custom CAPD ggplot2 Theme](https://github.com/usepa/ggcapdthemes), is based on the guidance put forth in the DVSG. It includes changes to default colors, chart layout, typography, and additional methods to further bring ggplot2 charts in line with other Power Sector data visualizations.
